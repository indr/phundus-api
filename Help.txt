How to start
************

  Before starting developing you should check the default
build properties located in file ".\Default.build.properties".
Override those you want by creating a new file named
"Local.build.properties".

  Since all AssemblyInfo.cs files are not under version
control, you have to call target init before starting
developing.

  Our deployment pipeline runs tests in two steps. First,
in the commit stage, unit and component tests are run. If the
build is successful, a production-like deployment is done to
run smoke/deployment and acceptance tests. To do so in your
development environment, just call target LET-ME-CONTRIBUTE.

  During development, you may want to run just some sort
of tests. These are your targets then: unit-test,
integration-test, acceptance-test

  You may also want the build script to prepare your
environment to run tests from within your IDE. These are your
targets then: init-integration-test, init-acceptance-test.
Notice that your test projects App.config files are not touched
by these init targets. At the moment you have to check those
file for the right settings yourself. And finally: There's of
course no init target for unit tests, since they don't depend
on anything. Not even the file system.

  Happy coding!
